## Overview

After getting my portfolio peer-reviewed, it was suggested that I work through the Python exercises on Exercism (https://exercism.org/dashboard) as a great way to showcase my Python learning journey. I welcome any feedback you may have on my solutions and would love to discuss why I chose particular methods to solve problems. I enjoy receiving feedback and am eager to improve.

## Description

Iâ€™m currently working through the Python track on Exercism and have so far covered concepts including numbers, loops, conditionals, strings, comparisons, and lists. This section will be constantly updated, so feel free to check back for my latest progress.
